=====================
Some rails projects defines `.ruby-version` file as 'ruby-3.0.6'. 
https://github.com/boston-library/JenkinsfileSample/blob/Nov17/.ruby-version

Our project '.ruby-version' file uses '3.0.6' format.  
https://github.com/boston-library/Commonwealth-public-interface/blob/capistrano/.ruby-version

Is there a preference setting that controls which format should be used?

Just curious.  

Another question is: can `ruby-3.0.6` for `.ruby-version` be directly changed to '3.0.6'?
